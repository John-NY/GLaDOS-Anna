THis was created 15 May 2012 to allow long replies to the client [jcd].
The function dostuff() was modified to read a file and send it to client.
Future functionality will include 
(1) argv[2] will be the name of the file to read.
(2) client input will specify a variable to return.
(3) the read file will be written to by scripts that report status 
    for each of the sensors and switches.
Once the server can pass infomation to a client, an Android application
can update itself from the server (from menu?  automatic?).
Then the challange becomes creating a responsive android application,
possibly via a service that runs and is accessed by the GUI.
The android app can also display the probablility of occupancy in a 
graphical way, as written in Notebook B.
