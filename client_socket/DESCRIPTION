===================//=======================
server listens for any client message
On receive, server sends command to relay.pl
when called, relay.pl forwards command directly to Arduino.
Arduino interprets client messages.

I want:
client is given a voice command from google's speech-to-text.
server listens for any client message
client message is a voice command or conversation.
option 1: server passes on command to script.pl
script.pl decides whether to talk to ALICE or to do stuff.
script.pl invokes the right sub-script or command.
sub-script does the action.
computer talks and does stuff!
